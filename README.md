# Sumo_Robot

This program was used for the final project in ECE 342 Junior Design II at Oregon State. The project consisted of making a Sumo Robot that could autonomously locate and push a wooden object out of a ring. Two ultrasonic sensors were used to locate the object and a infrared sensor was used to sense the arena boundaries. The arduino program was written for a Teensy microcontroller. There is also a bluetooth python program that runs on a windows computer. This simply gives a user remote control of the robot by using arrow keys on the a windows computer. The robot also has an OLED display for showing debugging information.
